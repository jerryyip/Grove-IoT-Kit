\#\#\#About Grove

Grove is a modular, ready-to-use tool set. Much like Lego, it takes a building block approach  to assembling electronics. The Grove system consists of a base shield and various modules with standardized connectors. The base shield allows for easy connection of any microprocessor input or output from the Grove modules, and every Grove module addresses a single function, such as a simple button or a more complex heart rate sensor. Each one comes with clear documentation and demo code to help you get started quickly.
